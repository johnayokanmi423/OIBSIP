# Data Analytics & Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of data analytics and machine learning tasks completed as part of hands-on practice and applied learning. Each notebook focuses on solving a specific business or analytical problem using Python, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques.

The projects emphasize data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation of results rather than just code execution.



##  Project Contents

# 1. Customer Segmentation (Task 3)

File:`Customer Segmentation (Task 3).ipynb`

## Objective:
To segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and attributes in order to support targeted marketing, personalization, and business decision-making.

## Key Steps:

* Data exploration and preprocessing
* Feature selection and scaling
* Clustering using unsupervised learning techniques
* Interpretation of customer segments

## Outcome:
Identified meaningful customer segments that can be used for improved customer targeting and strategy development.

### 2. Housing Price Prediction (Task 5)

File: `Housing prediction (Task 5).ipynb`

## Objective:
To build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on key features such as location, size, and other property characteristics.

## Key Steps:

* Data cleaning and handling missing values
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation

## Outcome:
Developed a regression-based model capable of predicting housing prices with reasonable accuracy and explaining key price drivers.

## 3. Customer Analysis (Task 1)

File: Customer (Task 1).ipynb

## Objective:  
To analyze customer data in order to uncover key behavioral trends and support better business decision-making through insights on spending, frequency, and customer value.

## Key Steps:

* Data cleaning and handling missing values  
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer patterns  
* Feature engineering and transformation  
* Visualization of trends in purchase behavior  
* Summary of key customer insights

## Outcome:  
Generated actionable insights on customer types, spending habits, and engagement levels—helping inform targeted strategies for retention, loyalty programs, and improved customer experience.
